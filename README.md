# audio-translator
Audio Translator is a Python-based application that allows users to translate audio files into different languages. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for translation and Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for converting the translated text back into audio. The user interface is built with PyQt5, providing a modern and interactive experience.
